	<b>Edit the displayed Episodes in the Episode Menu List.</b><br>
</p><hr>

- The game stores the displayed Episodes in the Episode Selection Menu as ID's, while there are 8 Episodes per Season.
    - Only 5 at max are actually visible and usable though.
	
- This Script can edit the list to even include the unofficial ones, however they aren't really worth using, because they have pretty much deleted most *if not* all of their content.
    - Useful I suppose, if you want `It All Began` into Season 1 so that it's 4 instead of 3 there, so you can always replay them on a Slot.
